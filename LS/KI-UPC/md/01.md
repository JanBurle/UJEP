# The C Programming Language

- created in the 1970s (BCPL 🠊 B 🠊 C) by
  [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie)
- general-purpose, procedural (imperative) programming
  language
- simple, small, relatively low-level
- close to the hardware (Von Neumann architecture), but still
  portable
- still used for system programming (OS kernels), embedded
  systems, device drivers, performance-critical applications
- associated with the UNIX operating system
- bootstrap language for many other languages (e.g. Python)

- typed, but weakly; today: C++ as a "better, stronger C"

## The program structure

- C program: set of functions and variables
- `main()` is the entry point, called by the OS

## Data types

#### fundamental:

- characters: `char` (byte),
- signed/unsigned integers: `int` (short, long)
- floating point numbers: `float`, `double`

#### derived:

- arrays `[]`
- pointers (memory addresses) `*`
- structures `struct`
- unions `union`
- enumerations `enum` (named integer constants)

#### special:

- bit fields

## Operations

#### over fundamental data types

- arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- bitwise: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
- assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=` ,`*=`, `/=`, `%=` ,`&=`, `|=`,
  `^=`
- comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

#### over derived data types

- arrays: indexing
- pointers: dereferencing `*`, pointer arithmetic `+`, `-`
- structures, unions, bit fields: member access `.`
- pointers: dereferencing and member access `->`

## Expressions

- arithmetic
- logical
- bitwise
- assignment
- conditional

## Statements

Statements can be:

- simple, _terminated_ by semicolon `;`
- compound (block), enclosed in braces `{ }`

Expressions are statements, but not all statements are
expressions:

- function calls
- loops (`for`, `while`, `do ... while`)
- conditionals (`if`, `switch`)

## Functions

- defined as: return type, name, parameters, body
- instead of procedures, return type `void`

Functions can be declared (prototype) without body.

## Other features

Everything else: input/output, memory management,
multithreading, must be implemented in a library:

- `stdio.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `string.h`
- `math.h`
- `pthread.h`, etc.

## Program

Two kinds of source files: header files (.h) for declarations,
source files (.c) for definitions.

## Preprocessor and macros

The preprocessor is purely textual, handles directives as
`#include`, `#define`, `#ifdef`. Macros are used for text
substitution, mostly for constants, inline functions,
fragments of code, etc.
