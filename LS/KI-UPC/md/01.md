C general-purpose, procedural programming language
small, not very high-level

connected with UNIX, successor of B, which was successor of BCPL
designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, and to require minimal run-time support.

typed, but weakly typed
today: C++ can be used as "better C", stronger type system
C++ itself is quite complex

C program: set of functions and variables
main() is the entry point of the program, called by the operating system

fundamental data types:
characters: char (byte), signed/unsiged
integers: int (short, long) signed/unsiged
floating point: float, double float

derived data types: arrays, pointers, structures, unions, enumerations

expressions: arithmetic, logical, bitwise, assignment, conditional
can be used as statements
statements: simple, terminated by semicolon,
compound (block) enclosed in braces

functions: defined with return type, name, parameters, body
can be called with arguments, return values
`void` functions do not return a value

program from separate files:
header files (.h) for declarations, source files (.c) for definitions

preprocessor: #include, #define, #ifdef, etc.
macros: text substitution, can be used for constants, inline functions, etc.

operations over fundamental data types:
arithmetic: +, -, _, /, %
logical: &&, ||, !
bitwise: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
assignment: =, +=, -=, _=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=
comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

operations over derived data types:
arrays: indexing, pointer arithmetic
pointers: dereferencing, pointer arithmetic
structures: member access (.), pointer to structure (->)
unions: member access (.)
enumerations: named integer constants
everything else implemented in C standard library

single-pass compiler, no optimizations, straightforward translation to assembly
single-threaded, no built-in support for concurrency (must use libraries or OS features)
