====== Analogue & Digital Audio (UA 14) ==
**analogue**: (adjective)
  * comparable, proportionate or related to some other quantity
**digital**: (adjective)
  * represented by numbers (as if counted on fingers)

**analogue recording (of sound)**:
  * a sound wave stored as some physical quantity varying similarly as the wave did
**digital recording**:
  * sound waves are repeatedly measured and the measurements are stored as numbers

To convert between analogue and digital signals:
  * ADC (sampling)
  * DAC (reconstruction)

Important attributes of a digital audio signal:
  * sampling rate: 44.1 kHz CD quality, 48 kHz DAT tape, 96 kHz professional recordings
  * bit depth (resolution): 16 bits CD quality, 24 (or more) bits professional recordings

Frequencies present in a digital signal must not be higher than //Nyquist// frequency = 1/2 of the sampling rate, otherwise aliasing occurs.

Low bit depth (resolution) of a digital signal is a cause of //quantization noise//.
