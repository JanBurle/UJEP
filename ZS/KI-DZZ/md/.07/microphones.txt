====== Microphones ==

  * transducers: convertors of sound energy -> mechanical energy -> electrical signal
  * sound is analogue, therefore microphones are analogue (not digital); "digital" microphones have a built-in ADC

=== sound energy > mechanical energy ==

  * a diaphragm ("divider", also called a membrane, "skin") vibrates with the sound waves
 
=== mechanical energy > electrical signal ==

Three commonly used types for professional audio work:

  * moving coil (dynamic microphones)
  * changing capacitance (condenser microphones)
  * ribbon

other types: carbon, electret, crystal microphones, and more

(most of the same principles - reversed - are used in loudspeakers)

===== How they work ==

===== Characteristics of microphones ==

  * //sensitivity// => the strength of the output signal
  * //polar pattern// (pickup pattern, directionality) => sensitivity varies with direction (and the pattern itself varies with frequency)
    * omnidirectional (not directional, ideally)
    * cardioid (unidirectional)
    * figure eight (bidirectional)
  * [[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/audio/mic3.html#c2|hyperphysics]]

dynamic microphones are omni and unidirectional, not bidirectional

condenser microphones can have any pickup pattern

ribbon microphones vary from bidirectional to hypercardioid

  * //frequency response// => sensitivity varies with frequency (sound coloration)
  * //number of channels (capsules)//
    * one - monophonic (mono)
    * two - stereophonic (stereo)
    * more - surround sound (sound field)

===== Which one to use ==

=== Dynamic (moving coil) microphones ==
  * sturdy
  * do not need external power
  * low self-noise, high output (voltage)
  * do not easily overload
  * high frequency sensitivity decreases with distance

=== Condenser microphones ==
  * need (more) careful handling
  * need external power (batteries, power supply, phantom power)
  * high sensitivity, high output
  * smooth frequency response, fast response to transients
  * crisp, clear sound
  * good for distance miking
  * may need a windscreen

=== Ribbon microphones ==
  * delicate ribbon
  * do not need external power
  * good frequency response
  * overload easily
  * "warm" sound (big ribbon: less sensitive to high frequencies)
  * may need a windscreen
